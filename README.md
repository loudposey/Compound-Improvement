## What is the New Method?

1. Empirical - Results count. We experiment to learn new facts.
2. Iterative - There will be unsuccessful attempts, these are fuel for the fire!
3. Humane - Sustainable pace, care, compassion, and respect for the people involved - customers, team members and stakeholders.
4. Identify and practice First Principles - Axioms and Rules form the guardrails, with wide latitude to explore.
5. Learn, Educate, Practice - 'If I knew better, I'd do better', writ large.

### OBJECTIVE (1) 

   I've worked most of my life in software development, so it's the idiom I know best. The objective, or problem statement, has changed little over the decades. 'When will it be done?' 'How much will it cost?' 'What should we do first?' 'What will happen if we do X, instead of Y?'
   
   Predictability, or estimation, prediction, fortune telling, or forecasting - if only we could plan better! The objective of every key stakeholder (the person who pays the bills, or is accountable for the paying of the bills) is to reduce the seemingly random chaos they experience in software development. Everything takes longer, costs more, works differently, has unforeseen impacts and surprises. How does anyone have the nerve to call this 'engineering'? 
   
   Let's start with three objectives, for now.
1. Understand predictability, a bit.
2. Understand management, a bit. 
3. Understand software engineering/development, a bit.

(Dang, I'm five bits short!)
(If you don't have a sense of humor, byte me!)

### PROLOGUE (0) 
   This mess started in the US Army, Basic Training, at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. As raw recruits, we were assigned to squads with a squad leader. Some squad leaders thrived, most failed, some spectacularly. I wondered 'Why are some successful and some not?' and began to try to take notice of the possible contributing factors. Some were loud, some quiet. Some gave clear orders, some gave direction, and some asked for help. Some took the credit for what was accomplished, others pointed to their squad. Some took the blame for what failed, others pointed to their squad... Very strange. 
   
   Today, decades later, I still recall the confusion caused by the myriad possible causes and effects. Early on, many effects seemed random. As I learned a bit, the effects became more predictable.
