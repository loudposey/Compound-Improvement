## What is the New Method?

1. Empirical - Results count. We experiment to learn new facts.
2. Iterative - There will be unsuccessful attempts, these are fuel for the fire!
3. Humane - Sustainable pace, care, compassion, and respect for the people involved - customers, team members and stakeholders.
4. Identify and practice First Principles - Axioms and Rules form the guardrails, with wide latitude to explore.
5. Learn, Educate, Practice - 'If I knew better, I'd do better', writ large.

### Management Observations, pt 2 (3)

   What is the first thing any Manager should know and understand?  (Long pause for effect) 
   
   Seriously, stop reading and ask yourself - what is the FIRST job of a Manager? What should they always be working on, trying to improve, practicing to gain proficiency and understanding?
   
   Please feel free to write down your answer at this time. There will be a quiz. This is the 'Pre-Test'. 
   
...

   Okay, now that you've got your answer down, let's try on a few disasters.
   
The FIRST job of a Manager is:

A) To please my boss!   Ahh, this poor sod took the PHB pill. This is a path of misery. You'll be miserable, your staff will be miserable, and your boss will be mostly miserable. If your boss is competent, you'll be done as a manager, but... That still gives you a 50/50 shot.

B) To deliver on time!   Hmm - an urgency to deliver value is a good indicator, but this is not the first job of a Manager. For example, any development team that had NO manager would have the same goal...

C) To get promoted!   Mr. Machiavelli,  please pick up line 2. While you might get promoted, you'll probably be found out, and treated as well as you've treated your employees. But perhaps not (see the segments about Survivorship Bias, and Clustering of Competencies).

D) To not get fired!   Well, we've all been here, haven't we? But this is not really an objective one can navigate by, as the winds change too frequently. Seriously, the course changes required for this objective are neck-snapping, and will leave one managing an empty boat in no time. 

...

   What is the FIRST job of a Manager?    For many years, my answer to this question was: 'To hire well.' 
   
   One thing I learned early was that good hiring managers get ahead. Their team has more skills, talent, expertise, motivation, spirit, energy, etc., so they find a way to win. It was that way in pickup basketball, and it's that way in every corporation. If you can identify talented people, and persuade them to join you, your chances are vastly improved. 
   
   I can't overstate this one, as it's truly game-changing. If one wants to be a good Manager (AT ANY LEVEL) one must be able to identify, persuade, guide, motivate, entice, and otherwise inveigle talented people to sign on to your rowboat (or yacht, or schooner, or battleship) and not only do the things they already know, but to learn new things, teach others the things they know, inspire each other to learn things no one knows how to do, and soldier on when no one knows how to do anything. 
   
   The rule in my head when rolling teams under this rule was simple, one I'd learned from an grizzled sergeant - 'Take care of your troops, and your troops will take care of you.' 
   
   When I began to assemble teams, I looked for people who showed the behaviors I valued. I trusted them, gave them all kinds of latitude, and hoped for the best - and it worked. And so the First Principle of the New Method was born - 'Hire Well.'
   
   After some years, it came clear that there was a more important FIRST Principle...

### Management Observations, pt 1 (2)

   When I got my first job in software, the first thing I noticed was that management was not good. They were nice enough people, but they were not super effective. Several didn't seem to know a lot about software development.  
   
   When I realized, a few years later, that I was likely to get a job as a Manager myself, I had to do some hard thinking. What the heck did I know about being a manager? 
   
1. Many tech managers were awful - so if I didn't suck terribly, I'd be considered at least average!
2. Many managers seemed uninterested in their staff - so if I at least paid attention, I might do better!
3. So much of what Scott Adams/Dilbert was printing every day was true - so if I just did better than the PHB, I'd be in the top half of all managers! 

   I wish I could say that I was wrong about any of that, but I wasn't. And it's not that different today, unfortunately. The way technical managers are selected, trained and mentored does not seem to have improved. On the other hand, I've made so many mistakes and had to learn from them, that I've come to realize the power of improvement, and especially Compound Improvement. If you're a manager, looking to become a manager, or are observing managers and you're interested in improvement, you're in the right place.

### OBJECTIVE OF THIS BLOG (1) 

   I've worked most of my life in software development, so it's the field I know best. The objective, or problem statement, has changed little over the decades. 'When will it be done?' 'How much will it cost?' 'What should we do first?' 'What will happen if we do X, instead of Y?'
   
   Predictability, or estimation, prediction, fortune telling, or forecasting - if only we could plan better! The objective of every key stakeholder (the person who pays the bills, or is accountable for the paying of the bills) is to reduce the seemingly random chaos they experience in software development. Everything takes longer, costs more, works differently, has unforeseen impacts and surprises. How does anyone have the nerve to call this 'engineering'? 
   
   Let's start with three objectives, for now.
1. Understand management, a bit. 
2. Understand software engineering/development, a bit.
3. Understand predictability, a bit.

(Dang, I'm five bits short!)
(If you don't have a sense of humor, byte me!)

### PROLOGUE (0) 
   This mess started in the US Army, Basic Training, at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. As raw recruits, we were assigned to squads with a squad leader. Some squad leaders thrived, most failed, some spectacularly. I wondered 'Why are some successful and some not?' and began to try to take notice of the possible contributing factors. Some were loud, some quiet. Some gave clear orders, some gave direction, and some asked for help. Some took the credit for what was accomplished, others pointed to their squad. Some took the blame for what failed, others pointed to their squad... Very strange. 
   
   Today, decades later, I still recall the confusion caused by the myriad possible causes and effects. Early on, many effects seemed random. As I learned a bit, the effects became more predictable.
