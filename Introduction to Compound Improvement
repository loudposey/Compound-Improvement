### Introduction to Compound Improvement

   Why 'Compound Improvement'? The title is a play on compound interest, the idea that over time we can earn interest on interest and so on. Many years ago it came clear to me that I could take improvements that I'd made in one part of my life, and apply them to others, sometimes to great effect. 
   
   Why isn't this blog more focused? Well, this is an experiment. If I wanted to learn to swim, I'd do some research first, and watch some YouTube videos. Eventually, I'd go to the pool. That's where this blog comes in - writing-wise, I'm going to the pool. All I know for sure is that I'm going to get wet, but I'm working toward improvement!
   
   Iteration is one of the keys to improvement, especially the compound variety, so things will change. You, dear reader, are part of that process. It begins with a bit of an idea on my part, and I invest some effort in writing some content to express the idea - then I put it in front of some potential users or consumers of the idea, and listen. What I hear helps be figure out what to try next. Thank You!
