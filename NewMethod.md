## What is the New Method?

1. Empirical - Results count. We experiment to learn new facts.
2. Iterative - There will be unsuccessful attempts, these are fuel for the fire!
3. Humane - Sustainable pace, care, compassion, and respect for the people involved - customers, team members and stakeholders.
4. Identify and practice First Principles - Axioms and Rules form the guardrails, with wide latitude to explore.
5. Learn, Educate, Practice - 'If I knew better, I'd do better', writ large.
